Adds the beautiful code editor from carbon.now.sh to the block editor.

== Description ==
# Carbon Code

#### The easiest way to create beautiful images of code comes to Gutenberg, the WordPress block editor!

## How To

- Add a **\"Carbon Code\" Block** to your post.
- Write your code directly in the editor, copy/paste, or even **drag a file into it**.
- Use the toolbar to **customize** the _syntax highlighting theme_, _background color/image_, _window effects/paddings_, _fonts_, and even _upload your own_. Then save your customizations as a _preset_.
- Brace for awesomeness!
- Your preview or published post will render your customized block with a handy **copy to clipboard button**.

## Thanks
